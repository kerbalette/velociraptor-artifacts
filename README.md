Artifacts for the amazing Incident Response tool https://www.velocidex.com/ - Velociraptor

The Velociraptor artifact project is designed to help Incident Responders to hunt for specific Indicators in the environment. These hunts can be specifically engineered to your systems. These hunts are intended to be used on both individual systems or across the entire environment.
